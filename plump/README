A card game strategy simulator for the game Plump.

This was another project of mine that I started to explore literate
programming. I also started it because I wanted to program but didn't have any
project to work on.

Anyway, this small python program was supposed to provide a framework for
testing different strategies for the card game Plump. The idea was that I
implemented some different strategies and played them against each other to see
which one was the best. I would then use the winning strategy when I played
Plump with my family.

I didn't get very far on this one though. I guess I lost the inspiration I
initially had.

This project was started during the summer 2007.
